# MMD_SurvivalPrediction

The repository is the official PyTorch implementation of the paper " 
Survival Prediction of Brain Cancer with Incomplete Radiology, Pathology, Genomics, and Demographic Data". 
The paper link is https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04419.pdf


## Prerequisites
* NVIDIA GPU + CUDA + cuDNN + python + pytorch
We used python >= 3.6, CUDA 11.4, pytorch >= 1.7.0 

## Usage
Unimodal embeddings and data splits have been provided
run python main.py to rebuild the multimodal data results
